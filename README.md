I created this game to resemble the handheld memory games called Simon Says. It is one of my earliest Python projects and it still holds a special place in my heart for all of the moving pieces it incorporates. 
It took a lot of trial and error to have the buttons light up and for the game to "remember" the moves you play and the moves it's playing. Along with keeping track of the score. 

You can either click on the buttons with your mouse or press the key corresponding to the desired color.
